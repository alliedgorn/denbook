# # Trace Chain System Design

# Trace Chain System Design

## Trace ID Format

| Layer | Precision | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Raw/Stored** | Nanoseconds | `2026-01-27T01:55:32.123456789` |
| **Display** | Milliseconds | `01:55:32.123_slug` |

**Philosophy**: Nanoseconds = exact moment of truth (Nothing is Deleted — Timestamps are truth)

## Trace Chain (Linked List)

```
2026-01-27T01:43:21.456789012_form-vs-formless (ROOT)
    │
    ├── 2026-01-27T01:45:12.789012345_transparency-rule (child)
    │
    └── 2026-01-27T01:52:33.012345678_glueboy-identity (child)
            │
            └── RESOLVED → Learning created
```

## Flow

```
/trace --thread "topic"     # Creates Trace ID (nanosec), opens thread
    ↓
chatting...
    ↓
/trace --add "sub-question" # Auto-links to parent trace
    ↓
more chat...
    ↓
/resolve                    # Closes trace chain, creates learning
```

## Why Nanoseconds (Raw)

1. **Exact truth** — captures precise moment of seeking
2. **Unique** — impossible collision
3. **Philosophy** — "Nothing is Deleted, Timestamps are truth"
4. **Sortable** — chronological order automatic

## Why Milliseconds (Display)

1. **Human readable** — easy to scan
2. **Practical** — enough precision for display
3. **Clean** — not overwhelming

## Connection to oracle_trace

Uses existing `parentTraceId` field to link traces into chains.

## Use Case: Soul Tuning

Trace chains enable philosophical discussions:
- Trace → Find related knowledge
- Thread → Discuss/debate
- Child traces → Explore sub-questions
- Resolve → Create learning from journey

Like **git for knowledge discovery**.
