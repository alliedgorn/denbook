# Server User Creation: Confirm First

Server User Creation: Confirm First

Always confirm before creating server accounts. Even when user says "yes please create", confirm specific details (username, shell, home dir) before running useradd.

WRONG: Run `useradd` immediately after request
RIGHT: Show details → Wait for explicit "yes" → Then create

Actions requiring confirmation: create user, delete user, add to sudo, change permissions, install packages, modify system config.

Learned from: Creating oracle-arthur on white.local without confirming details first.
